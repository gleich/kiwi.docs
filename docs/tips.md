# Tips

Writing all of my school work as code with LaTeX during high school has taught me some valuable tips and tricks to make the process better. If you're just getting started this might seem very overwhelming and almost like a waste of time. If you stick to it for like a week or two you will find yourself with a new skill and with a system that saves you time and helps organize everything.

## Snippets

Snippets are a _requirement_ to make writing LaTeX for school work a quick and frankly tolerable process. Instead of having to write out a ton of code for a bulleted list, you can simply create a snippet that allows you to type `it<TAB>` have it expand out to a bulleted list for you. Saves me a ton of time and is a must-have for this system. There should be some resources online for how to use snippets with your editor of choice.

## Google Drive Sync

Do you use Google Classroom for your schoolwork? The [Google Drive Desktop App](https://www.google.com/drive/download/) can automatically sync the pdfs generated by optic to your Google Drive account. Even if you don't use Google Classroom for school it's still a great way to backup all of your work or share a link to a document quickly.
