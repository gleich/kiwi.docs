# Initialize a kiwi project

First, you need to create a folder for your kiwi project. Once you have done that run the terminal command below in that directory. It will ask you a few questions and create a few files and folders.

```bash
kiwi setup
```

## What did we just get?

Here are the folders and files that kiwi just created for you:

| **File/Folder** | **Description**                                                                                                  |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `kiwi.toml`     | The configuration file for kiwi                                                                                  |
| `README.md`     | Basic README file                                                                                                |
